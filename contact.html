    <p>If you'd like to contact the creator of this website, please rethink this thought as he has lost the little amount of sanity he had left.</p>
    <p>No seriously, he's probably gone a bit mental by now and should not be contacted unless you are a licensed professional.</p>
    <p>If you've heeded the warnings above and still wish to contact the creator of this website, well you can't. So get over it.</p>
